A small app built with the Cinder creative coding library that displays a few of the shaders I've made, in pride colors. I would have used Shadertoy or something but I wanted to actually be able to switch between color palettes with the click of a button, and also add a textbox because why not. Currently there are just two shaders but whenever I feel like making another fun shader in my free time I will also try to pride-ify it.

I made the original version of the "flowie" shader on Shadertoy here: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XclfRf 

**The current release (probably) only works on M1 MacOS.**

## Controls
Press tab or shift+tab to switch between flags. Press left/right arrow keys to switch between shaders. Just type stuff in order to edit the message and move the textbox around by dragging.

## Future plans
- Figure out how to build the app for more platforms
- Add more flags and shaders!
- Maybe allow switching fonts
